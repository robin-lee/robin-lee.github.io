      <description>Spring Boot with Gradle because Maven is too verbose.
When I was looking for tutorials, it seemed like using gradle with Spring Boot is the lesser walked path. However, I think going down this path enables me to understand gradle better. This will be useful for Android development too.
It is to be noted that Spring has some integrations with the paid version of the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. As I am using the community edition, I will use the Spring CLI to setup the project.</description>
