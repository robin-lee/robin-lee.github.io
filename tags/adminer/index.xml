      <description>I always wanted to learn some backend development seriously and finally I have the opportunity to do so. I have played around with server setup in the past but most of the information has been forgotten.
This time round a development server will be setup in virtualbox using ubuntu server 14.04 LTS (support expires 2019). For 16.04 LTS, I think the apt-get command is replace with apt and there are many new changes&amp;hellip; To save some time and focus on learning backend development sticking with 14.</description>
