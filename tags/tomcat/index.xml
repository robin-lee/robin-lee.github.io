      <description>Developing You can find a few tutorials on how to create a basic (hello world) webapp with java servlets in eclipse so it will not be included here. As always my experience differs from such tutorials. It is never smooth sailing. You always have to configure or troubleshoot something even if your setup is exactly the same. The last time I did something with Servlets or JSP was in 2013 or 2014.</description>

      <description>I always wanted to learn some backend development seriously and finally I have the opportunity to do so. I have played around with server setup in the past but most of the information has been forgotten.
This time round a development server will be setup in virtualbox using ubuntu server 14.04 LTS (support expires 2019). For 16.04 LTS, I think the apt-get command is replace with apt and there are many new changes&amp;hellip; To save some time and focus on learning backend development sticking with 14.</description>
